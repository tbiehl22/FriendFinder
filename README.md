# FriendFinder

Build a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

Use Express to handle routing. Make sure to deploy the app to Heroku so other users can fill it out.
